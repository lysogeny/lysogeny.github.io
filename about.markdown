I am Jooa /joÀêa/ (they/them).

During the day I try to figure out adult neurogenesis at the German Cancer
Research institute and University Heidelberg.

This is a blog about things that are not related to neurogenesis.
I don't know where this blog will take me, but there will probably be random
thoughts and miscellaneous data analyses here.

If you have input or otherwise wish to comment on things you can find appropriate channels below.
