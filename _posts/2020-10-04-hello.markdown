I had long considered making a blog, but ultimately didn't because of the work
involved. Previously I had tried wordpress and some flat-file php system. Both
made things more complicated than they had to be. I came to think that
I need to build a simple blog in django, but never did this because it is still
somewhat involved. 

Some days ago I learned about [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and static site
generators in general. This sounded interesting because they avoid all of the
problems of more complicated setups (databases, php, to name a few). The main
thing that is missing to my is dynamic content, but after a while of
thinking I concluded that I don't need that.

After a while I have spent some time to make a jekyll site and modify the
included [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. I mainly changed the
footer, which was too large. I also hosted this on github pages just to avoid
changes on my VPS breaking my site. The process was surprisingly simple, most
problems arose due to me not properly reading the manuals or typos.

Anyhow, expect stuff in this space in the future.
